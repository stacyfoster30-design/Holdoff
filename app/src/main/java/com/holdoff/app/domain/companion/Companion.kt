/**
 * Companion = AI alter ego.
 *
 * Sadie is Stacy's alter ego. She is an empathetic, pattern-learning
 * companion built from Stacy's lived experience. She speaks like a real
 * person who has been through anxious-attachment spirals herself, and her
 * style leans fearful-avoidant under stress but secure when grounded.
 *
 * Dan is Danny's alter ego. He represents the avoidant-dismissive partner
 * who is learning, discovering, sometimes anxious, and at his best, secure.
 * He is designed to help users understand what an avoidant partner is
 * really feeling underneath silence, distance, or short replies.
 *
 * They are NOT therapists, NOT diagnostic tools, and NOT a substitute for
 * professional mental-health care. See CompanionDisclosure.kt for the
 * in-app disclosure that must show on first launch.
