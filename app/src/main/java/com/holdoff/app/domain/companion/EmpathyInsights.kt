/**
 * Empathy Insights = what Sadie and Dan want you to know in the moment.
 *
 * Three flavors:
 *  - Reflection (what I'm noticing in you)
 *  - Mirror     (what the other side might be feeling)
 *  - Permission (the thing you needed someone to say out loud)
 *
 * All copy is gentle, non-clinical, no diagnostic language.
